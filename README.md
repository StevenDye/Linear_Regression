# Linear_Regression
A simple linear regression model used in machine learning. This code creates random data, calculates the linear slope, y-intercept, the r squared value, and makes a prediction about a given value. All of these calculations are compared to the sklearn.linear_model LinearRegression results. Both the model and the sklearn results are plotted on a single graph.
